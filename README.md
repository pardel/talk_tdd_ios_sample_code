### Abstract
Are you interested in TDD? Join Paul to to learn how to get started with TDD in Swift, best practices and use of the tools at hand.

Whilst not a panacea for your iOS development troubles, TDD can prove to be something of a silver bullet and help mitigate long QA times. In this talk you'll be starting with exploring prototyping & tests in Playgrounds before migrating to an iOS project and unit test everything, including the UI elements.
